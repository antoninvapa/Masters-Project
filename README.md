# The Mergers of Black Hole Remnants of the First Stars Destroyed by Dark Matter

Here is my master's program. It's a puzzle with a lot of different Monte Carlo, graphs, classes, and functions. 

It is composed essentially into two notebooks with two Python fills with the function for the P-S and the output (1 notebook and 1 .py One for the output of the Press-Schechter theory (cosmological context), and 1 notebook and 1 .py the other for the simulation itself. The Press-Schechter classes in the .py could be use in many different types of projects that could need to set a cosmological context or use the Halo hierarchical structure.

## Installation

This project needs the packages: numpy, scipy, astropy, math, and matplotlib (and IPython.display for beautiful graphs).

Make sure to change the path in every file to access the external data in the folder.
